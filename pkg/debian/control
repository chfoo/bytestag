Description: Wide availability peer-to-peer file sharing program
 Bytestag is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing system that uses a distributed
 hash table (DHT) to achieve wide availability of files. Unlike the BitTorrent
 protocol, files are published entirely via DHT and do not require trackers
 or swarming. Each computer donates disk space and bandwidth for caching of
 published values.
